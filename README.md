# Node

## History & Why
- Started as high throughput, low latency socket server for network communications. Which started making use of "asynchronous event looping for IO bound communications".
- Threads can be very highly efficient for CPU bound process but threads were not as efficient as CPU when it comes to IO bound process.
- node is NOT for CPU bound tasks
- Best suitable as middle-wear proxy between front end and backend systems.



- How node connects to it's environment around it ?
  Node make uses of unix POSIX standards to communicate with it's surrounding environment, this helps node to work with IO ( remember javascript doesn't communicate with IO stream and hence node had to adopt this )

- console.log('text') vs console.error('text')
  In console or terminal (if node) we would see both of them printing without any much difference but in system level console.error('text') is redirected to different output using streams, so using console.error('text') is better while handling error's.



## Pointers
 - `process` is available all over our program
 - `stdout` is one of the three available standard streams, used for output. Example: `process.stdout.write("Hello node")`;
 - By default most IO operations returns low level buffer, hence using console.log on reading file data will output actual low level buffer data. Hence use `process.stdout.write(data)`
 - node focuses on everything to be asynchronous but the start of the script. Hence `require` is synchronous.
 - node's standard signature for callback functions take `error` as first param. i.e `function callback(err, data){ }`.



## Quick Pointers

### 1.0 Making Executable
Typically we will execute our node script with command like `node fileName.js`, however if we make this file as an executable then we don't really need to pass in the `node`, below is the step to do that.
```shell
chmod u+x fileName.js

# now we can execute the script by doing so
./fileName.js
```

### 2.0 Define as node file
Usually if we are writing shell script we define `shebang` at the top of the file to let the compiler know this is of type `shell` script i.e `#!/bin/bash  `. Similarly, phython, perl, list and even node has it's own
```shell
#!/usr/bin/env node
```
The main takeaway from this above shebang is, instead of finding installed node path for this script to use we are letting the environment do the job for us. Hence we are pointing to `env` and then asking env to look for `node`.

### 3.0 Handle Arguments
we could capture all the passed arguments from the `argv` command but it will send array of commands which we need to process. Let us look into how `argv` works, if we use `process.argv` then it will return installed node path and path to file in an array. If we do `process.argv.slice(2)` it would slice first two elements and returns the third passed argument. The best way to handle this is using `minimist` package which will parse the array of objects and returns objects.

#### 3.1 Processing Args
if we add code as mentioned below to `processArgs.js` and execute by running `node processArgs.js` then we will see commented output.
```javascript
console.log(process.argv.slice(2));  // [ '--hello=node', '-hi101' ]
var args = require("minimist")(process.argv.slice(2));
console.log(args) // { _: [], hello: 'node', h: 'i101' }
```

#### 3.2 Customize Args
If we want to enforce some customization based on passed argument name then we could pass in object of key value pair as second argument to `minimist`. Let us look into an example,
```javascript
var args = require("minimist")(process.argv.slice(2), {
  boolean: ["help"],
  string: ["name"]
});

console.log(args); //{ _: [], hello: true, name: '' }
```
ran the file by doing `./fileName.js --hello=node --name`.

#### 3.3 Path
`path` is not package which we can use to find the path of the file or executing command. Below example is continuation of the above,
```javascript
// args are derived from above minimist handling

let path = require('path');
let filepath = path.resolve(args.file);
console.log(filepath); // path of the file
```
Similarly if we make use of in build `__dirname` it will print the absolute path to the current directory.

#### 3.4 File Access
`fs` node package can be used to read and write from the file. we make use of synchronous process `readFileSync` or asynchronous prcess `readFile` and parsed `args` from minimist package.

##### 3.4.1 Synchronous File Processing:
```javascript
// fileName: processFile.js
var fs = require('fs');

var file_args = require("minimist")(process.argv.slice(2), {string: ["file"]});
const filepath = path.resolve(file_args.file);

function processFile(filepath){
    var content = fs.readFileSync(filepath);
    process.stdout.write(content); // string buffer to print the data
    console.log(content); // this will print actual low level buffer
}

processFile(filepath)
```
we can run the script by doing below, where `hello.txt` is the file to be read.
```shell
./processFile.js --file=files/hello.txt
```
we can make the `readFileSync` handle the buffering for us by using second parameter as `utf8` encoding. Then the line of code becomes like `var content = fs.readFileSync(filepath, 'utf8');`.

##### 3.4.2 Asynchronous File Processing     

It is okay to read the file synchronously but asynchronous is always a better option as node is built for asynchronous processing. So we will convert above synchronous code to asynchronous by changing `readFileSync` to `readFile` and handling the `callback` instead pf expecting the content.
```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

var file_args = require("minimist")(process.argv.slice(2), {string: ["file"]});
const filepath = path.resolve(file_args.file);

function processFile(filepath){
    fs.readFile(filepath, function onContets(err, content){
        if(err){
            error(err.toString())
        }else{
            process.stdout.write(content)
        }
    });
}

processFile(filepath);
```
##### 3.4.3 Read File as Standard input

If we are interested in reading the file content from the command line and run the node script along with that then we can do that by installing another node package called `get-stdin`. This returns a promise so the response should be handled using then. i.e
```javascript
var getStdin = require('get-stdin');

// handling reading files
getStdin().then(handleFileContentFunction).catch(errorFunction);

// handleFileContentFunction - should take care of handling the content
// errorFunction - should handle error logic.
```

##### 3.4.4 Reading ENV variables
```javascript
// Syntax: process.env.NAME_VARIABLE

var BASE_PATH = path.resolve(
    // if BASE_PATH found use it or use the current directory
    process.env.BASE_PATH || __dirname
);
```
we can test this by executing `BASE_PATH='/testfolder/' ./processFile.js` or `./processFile.js`.
