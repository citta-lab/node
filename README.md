# Node

## History & Why
- Started as high throughput, low latency socket server for network communications. Which started making use of "asynchronous event looping for IO bound communications".
- Threads can be very highly efficient for CPU bound process but threads were not as efficient as CPU when it comes to IO bound process.
- node is NOT for CPU bound tasks
- Best suitable as middle-wear proxy between front end and backend systems.
